# hello-world

Hello Humans!
I am Shaikzubedi from India.
I've got around 6+ years of professional experiance as SAP Consultant
basically in BI and reporting.
Nearly for two months now i'm in to coding. Really want to work on R & Python and work as a Data Scientist in the near future.
I'll be putting my work sheets here. It'll help me understand whats missing in me and also I can get help from others as well. Bravo!
